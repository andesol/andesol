### Hi there, stranger ğŸ‘‹

I'm Andreu, a web developer aficionado. My Github profile is mainly a collection of broken toys. Unpolished apps I abandon as soon as I learn what I wanted. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... tying to get a grasp on what they call "Fullstack Javascript"
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular & Nest.js
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever I may help.
